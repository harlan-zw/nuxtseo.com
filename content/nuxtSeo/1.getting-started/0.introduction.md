## Background

Technical SEO is tricky and boring. It requires many moving parts that need to work well together. Configuring all of these parts correctly is a challenge.

## Nuxt SEO

Nuxt SEO is the collective name of modules focused on improving your technical SEO.

:AllModules

Nuxt SEO is also itself an alias module.

## Nuxt SEO Module: @nuxtjs/seo

:ModuleCard{slug="nuxt-seo" class="w-1/2"}

The Nuxt SEO module is simply an alias that combines all the other SEO modules into a single installation.

```ts
// This is all it does!
export default defineNuxtModule({
  async setup() {
    for (const module of modules) {
      await installModule(await resolvePath(module), {})
    }
  },
})
```

When using Nuxt SEO you are free to use this alias or install the modules individually. The choice is yours as
all sites are different and have different requirements.

## Site Config

To ensure all modules work well together, Nuxt SEO includes a module called Site Config. This module is itself used across all modules to ensure they are configured correctly.

You do not need to install this module manually, it is installed automatically when you install any of the SEO modules.
