## Install Nuxt SEO Alias

The `@nuxtjs/seo` module is an alias module that combines all the other SEO modules into a single installation.

:ModuleInstall{name="@nuxtjs/seo"}

### Manual Installation

If you'd prefer more control over which modules you install, you can install them separately, please see the
individual module pages for installation instructions.

:AllModules

## Next Steps

All modules are now installed and configured!

See the [Using the Modules](/docs/nuxt-seo/guides/using-the-modules) guide to learn how to use them and make sure
to check out the [SEO Go Live Checklist](/learn/going-live) once you're ready to ship.
