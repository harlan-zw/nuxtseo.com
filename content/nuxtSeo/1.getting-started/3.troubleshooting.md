## Troubleshooting FAQ

### Can I just use the modules separately?

Yes! Nuxt SEO is designed to be flexible and work however you need it to.

### Why does my production build go up so much?

Nuxt SEO includes many features that only run on the server. These server-side features can increase the size of your
production build by a few megabytes, but won't affect the performance of your site as the modules are lazy loaded.

If the production build size is a concern, you can [disable the modules](/docs/nuxt-seo/guides/using-the-modules) you don't need.

If you are using Nuxt SEO in a serverless environment, you may want to keep your workers under 1mb. The module that
will contribute the most to your worker size is `nuxt-og-image`.

If you are not using `ogImage`, you can disable it, otherwise consider using [Zero Runtime](/docs/og-image/guides/zero-runtime) mode.

### What happened To Nuxt SEO Kit?

The Nuxt SEO Kit module was the initial version of Nuxt SEO.

While it generally worked great for some users, it was only useful for server-side generated Nuxt Sites and in turn its feature
set was much more limited.

It has been deprecated in favour of the new Nuxt SEO module.

See the [migration guide](/docs/nuxt-seo/migration-guide/nuxt-seo-kit) for more information.
