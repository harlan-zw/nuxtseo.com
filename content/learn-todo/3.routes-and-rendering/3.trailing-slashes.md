## Introduction

A trailing slash is the "/" at the end of a URL. For example:
- With trailing slash: `/about/`
- Without trailing slash: `/about`

While trailing slashes don't directly impact SEO rankings, they can create technical challenges:

1. **Duplicate Content**: When both `/about` and `/about/` serve the same content without proper canonicalization, search engines have to choose which version to index. While Google is generally good at figuring this out, it's better to be explicit.

2. **Crawl Budget**: On large sites, having multiple URLs for the same content can waste your [crawl budget](/learn/controlling-crawlers#improve-organic-traffic).

3. **Analytics Accuracy**: Different URL formats can split your analytics data, making it harder to track page performance.

The solution is simple: pick one format and stick to it by [redirecting](/learn/controlling-crawlers/redirects) the other and set
[canonical URLs](/learn/controlling-crawlers/canonical-urls).

## Vue Router

By default, all routes in Vue Router are case-insensitive and match routes with or without trailing slashes. For example, `/users` will match:
- `/users`
- `/users/`
- `/Users/`

### Quick Implementation

Control trailing slash behavior through router configuration:

```ts
import { createRouter } from 'vue-router'

const router = createRouter({
  strict: true,
})
```

## Quick Implementation

In Vue, you can control trailing slash behavior through router configuration:

::code-group

\```ts [Vue Router]
import { createRouter } from 'vue-router'

const router = createRouter({
// Make routes case-sensitive and enforce trailing slash rules
strict: true,
sensitive: true,
// your other config
})
\```

\```ts [Nuxt Config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Remove trailing slashes (default)
  router: {
    trailingSlash: false
  }
})
\```

::

### Router Options Explained

Vue Router provides two key options for URL matching:

- `strict: true` - Enforce trailing slash rules (e.g., `/users` won't match `/users/`)
- `sensitive: true` - Make routes case-sensitive (e.g., `/users` won't match `/Users`)

You can set these globally or per-route:

\```ts
const router = createRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/users',
      // Override global settings per-route
      strict: true,
      sensitive: true,
      component: Users
    }
  ]
})
\```

## Avoiding Duplicate Content

The main reason to care about trailing slashes is to avoid having the same content accessible at multiple URLs:

```bash
https://mysite.com/about/
https://mysite.com/about
https://mysite.com/About  # with case-insensitive routing
