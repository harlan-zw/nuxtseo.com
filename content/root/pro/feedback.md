### Educational Content Needs

Your feedback was clear that educational content is just as important as the tools themselves. Here's what you asked for:

- **Developer-centric SEO explanations**: _"Routing me to resources that demystify SEO for me"_
- **Code examples**: _"The more GitHub repos you have, the better. I can read the code."_
- **Strategy guidance**: _"What's relevant to do Off-Site, what are the steps to boost a page on launch"_
- **Video walkthroughs**: _"Video explainers are always welcome"_

This aligns perfectly with the feedback that 40% of you are new to SEO and are specifically looking for Nuxt-specific technical education for SEO.

## Detailed Module Insights

Let's look deeper at what you told me about each module:

### SEO Analyze (8.4/10)
The clear winner across all experience levels. You value:
- Build-time validation to prevent SEO mistakes
- Clear guidance on improving existing pages
- Automated checks that feel like "extra guardrails"

_"SEO Analyze seems like more easy SEO build time wins and it's nice to have the extra guardrails."_

### Google Search Console (7.8/10)
Strong interest particularly from those already using GSC:
- Simplifying complex data into actionable insights
- Connecting page performance to specific improvements
- Integrating analytics into the development workflow

_"Google search console is a bit sparse on info, but what is there often feels disjointed/nonsensical so maybe insights with a more direct connection to each page during build time will help."_

### Internal Links (7.0/10)
Moderate enthusiasm with interesting educational gaps:
- Some users aren't familiar with internal linking importance
- Others see high value in automated suggestions
- All agree that implementation should be straightforward

_"More easy SEO wins from the Link Checker at build time is always good."_

### Redirects (5.4/10)
The most polarized module, with responses ranging from 2/10 to 10/10:
- Many already have solution in place
- Others see high value in automated 404 prevention
- The "magic" factor is appealing to some

_"I quite enjoy my redirects file on CF pages, not sure I'll get much use from this module."_

## Challenges & Pain Points

Beyond feedback on specific modules, you shared several common challenges:

### SEO Knowledge Gap
Many of you expressed difficulty connecting development knowledge with SEO concepts:

_"I don't know what I don't know and trying to unravel the stack between 'nuxt.config.js' and 'the theory of SEO' and 'my marketing team's wants and needs' is difficult."_

### Technical Implementation Hurdles
Even those with SEO knowledge struggle with implementation details:

_"I often feel lost about routeRules."_

_"I found it hard to customize if I wanted to hide certain pages I'm not using in my links but exist as routes (in /pages) and don't want them indexed or mapped."_

### Time Management

Many of you purchased Nuxt SEO Pro specifically to save time:

_"I have many other things to do other than SEO, so I thought your package would help me gain time."_


## Conclusion

Thank you again for your support and feedback. This analysis has been incredibly valuable in shaping the future of Nuxt SEO Pro.
