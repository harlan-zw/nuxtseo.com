## Introduction

Page titles are crucial for SEO. They're your primary call-to-action in search results and help users understand your page's content and context.

```html
<head>
  <title>Mastering Titles in Vue · Vue SEO</title>
</head>
```

While setting page titles in Vue is straightforward, certain scenarios can be tricky. Let's start with the essential patterns you should follow.

## Vue Title Best Practices

Here are the key practices for handling page titles in Vue:

**1. Use a title template**

```ts
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: '%s | %siteName',
  templateParams: {
    siteName: 'MyApp' // set a site name
  }
})
```

**2. Always use reactive data with `useHead()`{lang="ts"}**

Makes sure our page titles are always reactive, I'd personally recommend using computed getter syntax which is the VueUse way.

```ts
const title = ref('Loading...')

useHead({
  // computed getter syntax
  title: () => `${title.value} - hold up!`
})
```

**3. Use `useSeoMeta()`{lang="ts"} for SEO meta tags and titles.**

```ts
useSeoMeta({
  title: 'Home',
  description: 'Welcome to MyApp',
})
```

**4. Leverage template params for consistency**

One of my favourite ways of using template params is to make sure we always have an `og:title` set. This can be done
globally with one line of code.

You can use template params in any meta tag, not just the title.

```ts
// will always use the page title
useSeoMeta({ ogTitle: '%s' })
```

## Understanding the Title Tag in Vue

The `<title>` tag displays text in browser tabs and typically appears as your page's heading in search engine results (SERPs).

In Vue, you might be tempted to set titles directly:

```ts
// ❌ Careful! This won't work in SSR
document.title = 'Home'
```
This approach has two major issues:

It breaks during Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Search engines may not properly index your titles

Instead, use Vue's head manager [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/).

## Dynamic Page Titles with `useHead()`{lang="ts"}

Now that we understand why direct title manipulation won't work, let's use Unhead's [`useHead()`{lang="ts"}](https://unhead.unjs.io/) composable to set titles properly:

```vue twoslash [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'Home'
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home</title>
</head>
```

This single line creates an SSR-friendly title that search engines can read. The composable handles all the complexity of managing your document head in both client and server environments.

You can use this in any component and set any `<head>`{lang="html"} tag you like.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'Welcome to MyApp' }
  ]
})
```

### Reactivity with `useHead()`{lang="ts"}

As we're using Vue, we may be dealing with dynamic data that contains the page title, meaning we can only set
the title once the data has been fetched.

[Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/) has first-party Vue support, supporting any input as a ref, reactive or computed value.

A red flag you may come across in your code is if you find yourself destructing reactive data before passing it to `useHead()`{lang="ts}.

```ts twoslash
useHead({
  title: myTitle.value // ❌ Avoid destructuring reactive data
})
```

Instead, pass the reactive data directly to `useHead()`{lang="ts} to ensure it's reactive.

```ts twoslash
useHead({
  title: myTitle // ✅ Pass in reactive data, don't destruct it
})
```

This is important when we may have data that gets refreshed or updated, such as a blog post title or user profile name.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const post = ref(null)
const title = computed(() => post.value?.title)

onMounted(async () => {
  const data = await fetch('/api/post')
  post.value = await data.json()
})

useHead({
  title,
})
</script>
```

### SEO Concerns

Always set page titles during server-side rendering (SSR) to ensure search engines can read them. While SPA
pages may have their titles honored by search engines, it's not guaranteed.

```vue [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const postTitle = ref('Loading...')
useHead({
  title: postTitle
})
// ❌ Avoid fetching data onMounted, it won't be available in SSR
onMounted(async () => {
  const data = await fetchPostData()
  postTitle.value = data.title
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Loading...</title>
</head>
```

## Setting Up Title Templates in Vue

You may notice that most people set up their titles with a site name and a separator, this is seen as a best practice as it
can help with brand recognition and SEO.

```html
<head>
  <title>Home | MySite</title>
</head>
```

Creating your own title like this is simple using `useHead()`{lang="ts"} with a [Title Template](https://unhead.unjs.io/usage/guides/title-template).

```vue twoslash [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: '%s | MySite'
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home | MySite</title>
</head>
```

The `%s` token is a special placeholder that get replaced with your page title or an empty string if no title is set.

### Resetting the Title Template

If you need to reset the title template for a specific page, you can pass `null` to the `titleTemplate` option.

```vue [input.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: null
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home</title>
</head>
```

## Template Params

Template params provide a powerful way to create dynamic titles and meta tags. While Unhead v2 includes the `%s` token by default for the current page title, additional template params require installing the Template Params plugin:

```ts
import { TemplateParamsPlugin } from '@unhead/vue'

// In your app setup
const head = injectHead()
head.use(TemplateParamsPlugin)
```

Once the plugin is installed, you can use custom template params throughout your application as well as the
`%separator` param.

Define custom template params to maintain consistent formatting:

```vue twoslash [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useHead({
  title: 'Home',
  titleTemplate: '%s %separator %siteName',
  templateParams: {
    separator: 'x',
    siteName: 'MySite'
  }
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Home x MySite</title>
</head>
```

You can choose your own separator character when setting up your title template:

```ts
type separator = '|' | '-' | '—' | '•' | '·' | '❤️'
```

You can use template params in other head tags too, such as meta descriptions and open graph tags.

```ts
useHead({
  templateParams: {
    siteName: 'MyApp'
  },
  title: 'Home',
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'Welcome to %siteName - where we make awesome happen' },
    { property: 'og:title', content: 'Home | %siteName' },
    { property: 'og:description', content: 'Check out %siteName today!' }
  ]
})
```

## Social Share Titles in Vue

Social platforms use different meta tags for sharing titles.

:FigureImage{src="/nuxt-x-share.png" alt="Nuxt X Share" lazy="true"}

In the above we can see the title "Nuxt: The Intuitive Vue Framework".

This title is set using the `twitter:title` meta tag and will fall back to the `og:title` meta tag if not set.

Remembering how to use the meta tags can be annoying, so we can use the [`useSeoMeta()`{lang="ts"}](https://unhead.unjs.io/usage/composables/use-seo-meta) composable to set these up.

```vue [input.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useSeoMeta({
  titleTemplate: '%s %separator Health Tips',
  title: 'Why you should eat more broccoli',
  // og title is not effected by titleTemplate, we can use template params here if we need
  ogTitle: 'Hey! Health Tips %separator 10 reasons to eat more broccoli.',
  // explicit twitter title is only needed when we want to display something just for X
  twitterTitle: 'Hey X! Health Tips %separator 10 reasons to eat more broccoli.',
})
</script>
```

```html [output.html]
<head>
  <title>Why you should eat more broccoli | Health Tips</title>
  <meta property="og:title" content="Hey! Health Tips — 10 reasons to eat more broccoli." />
  <meta name="twitter:title" content="Hey X! Health Tips — 10 reasons to eat more broccoli." />
</head>
```
