## Introduction

Search engines read your URLs before they render your content. The URL `/products/shoes` ranks better than `/products?category=shoes` because it's clearer. The URL `/about/` and `/about` are treated as different pages unless you tell crawlers otherwise.

Your choice of rendering mode (SSR, SSG, SPA) determines whether search engines see your content immediately or have to wait for JavaScript to execute. Most crawlers can handle JavaScript, but not all do it well.

## Rendering Modes

Vue applications can be built with different rendering strategies. Each has different implications for how search engines access your content.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

The server generates HTML on every request. Crawlers receive full HTML immediately.

Common SSR solutions for Vue:
- Vite SSR
- Quasar SSR mode
- Custom Node.js server with Vue renderer

**When to use SSR:**
- Content changes frequently (news sites, social feeds)
- Pages need personalization
- Real-time data display

**SEO impact:** Best for most sites. Crawlers get full content immediately. Server load increases with traffic.

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

HTML is pre-rendered at build time. All pages exist as static files.

Common SSG solutions for Vue:
- VitePress (for documentation)
- Vite SSG plugin
- Custom build scripts

**When to use SSG:**
- Content changes infrequently (blogs, documentation)
- Known set of pages at build time
- Maximum performance needed

**SEO impact:** Excellent. Fast response times. Crawlers get instant HTML. Requires rebuild for content updates.

### Single Page Application (SPA)

Browser renders everything. Server sends minimal HTML shell.

Default Vue Router behavior with Vite.

**When to use SPA:**
- Behind authentication
- Admin panels, dashboards
- Apps that don't need SEO

**SEO impact:** Poor. Search engines must execute JavaScript. Google handles this, but other crawlers struggle. Avoid for public content.

## Mode Comparison

| Mode | Crawler Sees HTML | Initial Load | Server Load | Best For |
|------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| SSR | Immediately | Fast | High | Dynamic content, frequently updated |
| SSG | Immediately | Fastest | None | Static content, blogs, docs |
| SPA | After JavaScript | Slow | Low | Authenticated apps, admin panels |

## URL Structure Matters

### Trailing Slashes

Search engines treat `/about` and `/about/` as different pages. Pick one format and stick to it.

With Vue Router, configure trailing slash handling:

```ts
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes: [
    // Define routes with consistent trailing slash usage
    { path: '/about/', component: About },
    { path: '/products/', component: Products }
  ],
  strict: true // Enforce trailing slashes
})
```

Read the [trailing slashes guide](/learn-seo/vue/routes-and-rendering/trailing-slashes) for implementation details.

### Clean URLs

Query parameters make URLs harder to crawl and rank.

**Bad:**
```
/products?category=shoes&color=red&sort=price
```

**Good:**
```
/products/shoes/red?sort=price
```

Put important information in the path. Use query parameters for filters and sorting only.

### Dynamic Routes

Vue Router's dynamic routes create SEO-friendly URLs automatically.

```ts
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/products/:category/:id',
    component: Product
  }
]
```

This generates `/products/shoes/123` instead of `/products?category=shoes&id=123`.

Read the [routes guide](/learn-seo/vue/routes-and-rendering/routes) for advanced patterns.

## Why URL Structure Matters

URLs appear in search results. Users see them before clicking. `/learn-seo/vue/seo-basics` tells users what the page contains. `/page?id=1523` doesn't.

Search engines use URLs to understand site hierarchy. `/products/shoes/running` shows clear categorization. `/item/12345` doesn't.

Broken URL changes lose search rankings. Use 301 redirects when restructuring. Never break external links.

### Crawl Budget

Google allocates limited time to crawl your site. Poor URL structure wastes this budget.

Problems that burn crawl budget:
- Duplicate content from inconsistent trailing slashes
- Pagination without canonical tags
- Infinite URL variations from filters
- Redirect chains (`/a` → `/b` → `/c`)

### Performance Impact

Rendering mode affects Time to First Byte (TTFB), a ranking factor.

- SSG: ~10ms TTFB
- SSR: ~100-300ms TTFB
- SPA: Fast TTFB but slow First Contentful Paint

Search engines wait for content to appear. SSG and SSR show content immediately. SPA requires JavaScript execution first.
