## Pre-Launch Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify these items:

- Production domain configured and SSL certificate active
- `robots.txt` allows search engine crawlers
- No `noindex` meta tags on pages you want indexed
- Sitemap generated and accessible at `/sitemap.xml`
- Canonical URLs point to production domain (not localhost)
- Social preview images working
- Mobile-friendly design (use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test)
- Core Web Vitals passing in development
- 404 pages return proper status codes
- Redirects from old URLs configured (if redesigning)

Don't delay your launch chasing perfection. Ship with working fundamentals, then iterate.

## Going Live

Your site needs two things to appear in search results: be crawlable and be indexed.

Crawlability means search engines can access your pages. Indexing means they've added your pages to their database.

Read the [Going Live guide](/learn-seo/vue/launch-and-listen/going-live) for deployment strategies and common pitfalls.

## Submitting to Search Engines

Google and Bing won't automatically know your site exists. Submit your sitemap directly:

**Google Search Console:**
1. Visit [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add your property (domain or URL prefix)
3. Verify ownership (DNS record, HTML file, or meta tag)
4. Submit your sitemap at Indexing > Sitemaps

**Bing Webmaster Tools:**
1. Visit [bing.com/webmasters](https://www.bing.com/webmasters)
2. Add your site
3. Verify ownership (similar methods to Google)
4. Submit your sitemap

Indexing takes days to weeks. Google prioritizes sites with backlinks and regular content updates.

## Monitoring Indexing Status

Check if Google has indexed your pages:

```bash
# Search for your domain
site:yourdomain.com

# Check specific page
site:yourdomain.com/specific-page
```

Google Search Console shows detailed indexing data under Coverage or Page Indexing reports. Look for:

- **Indexed pages:** Successfully added to Google's index
- **Discovered - currently not indexed:** Google found it but hasn't indexed it yet
- **Crawled - currently not indexed:** Google crawled it but chose not to index it
- **Excluded:** Pages blocked by robots.txt, noindex tags, or redirects

Not every page needs indexing. Admin panels, login pages, and duplicate content should stay excluded.

## Performance Tracking

Set up these tools after launch:

**Google Search Console:**
- Tracks impressions, clicks, and position in search results
- Shows which queries bring traffic
- Alerts you to indexing issues
- Free and directly from Google

**Google Analytics:**
- Monitors organic traffic trends
- Shows user behavior after they arrive
- Tracks conversions from search traffic
- Free with detailed reporting

**Third-party tools (optional):**
- Ahrefs: Backlink monitoring, keyword rankings, competitor analysis
- SEMrush: Similar to Ahrefs with additional marketing features
- Plausible/Fathom: Privacy-focused analytics alternatives

Start with Search Console and Analytics. Add paid tools only when you're actively working on SEO growth.

## What to Monitor

Track these metrics weekly:

**Search Console:**
- Total impressions (how often you appear in search)
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Average position for target keywords
- Coverage errors (pages failing to index)

**Analytics:**
- Organic traffic trends
- Bounce rate on landing pages
- Time on page for key content
- Conversion rates from organic traffic

**Manual checks:**
- `site:yourdomain.com` count in Google
- Target keyword rankings (search them yourself)
- Mobile usability errors
- Core Web Vitals scores

Don't obsess over daily fluctuations. Search rankings shift constantly. Look for trends over weeks and months.

## Building Initial Momentum

New sites start with zero authority. Accelerate indexing:

**Submit to directories:**
- Industry-specific directories relevant to your niche
- Local business directories if applicable
- Avoid spam directories—they hurt more than help

**Create backlinks:**
- Guest posts on established sites
- Share on social media
- Ask partners or clients to link to you
- Create linkable content (tools, research, guides)

**Publish consistently:**
- Search engines favor sites that update regularly
- Add new content weekly if possible
- Update existing pages with fresh information
- Fix broken links and outdated content

Quality backlinks from authoritative sites matter more than quantity from spam sites.

## Common Post-Launch Issues

**Site not indexing after weeks:**
- Check `robots.txt` isn't blocking crawlers
- Verify no `noindex` meta tags
- Confirm sitemap submitted correctly
- Build a few backlinks to signal the site is real

**Pages indexed but not ranking:**
- Normal for new sites—patience required
- Check if content matches search intent
- Improve title tags and meta descriptions
- Add internal links from other pages

**Indexing dropped suddenly:**
- Check Search Console for manual actions
- Verify hosting is stable (no downtime)
- Look for accidental `noindex` tags after updates
- Review recent code deployments

**High impressions, low clicks:**
- Improve title tags and meta descriptions
- Check if content matches what users expect
- Look at competing results for better positioning
- Consider featured snippet opportunities

## Next Steps

Focus on these after your site is indexed:

1. Monitor Search Console weekly for issues
2. Track your most important keyword rankings
3. Build backlinks through outreach and content
4. Keep publishing high-quality content
5. Fix technical issues as they appear

SEO is a long game. Most sites take 3-6 months to see meaningful organic traffic.
