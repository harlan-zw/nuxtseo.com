Google Search Console has valuable data about your site and its organic growth.

While this data is accessible
through the Google Search Console website, it can be difficult to drill down into what you want.

For example, if you wanted to check the top keywords for a specific page and see how they are trending, you would need
to manually figure it out by comparing data yourself.

In my work through [Request Indexing](https://requestindexing.com) I have a deep knowledge of the Google Search Console API and how to use it to
get the most out of your data that can help you inform choices that will grow your organic traffic.

The module will allow you to open the Nuxt DevTools and see exactly which keywords are generating traffic to your pages and how
they're trending and which pages may be competing on keywords.

You'll own the data and be able to make informed decisions on how to grow your organic traffic.
