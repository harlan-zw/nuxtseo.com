The web is changing quickly with more and more traffic being replaced with AI agents and LLMs. While these agents
can crawl websites, they often struggle to find relevant content or fully understand the context of a page given the
large amount of context they need to process.

Nuxt AI Index aims to solve this by providing a platform-agnostic [AI Index](https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-ai-index-for-all-our-customers/) that allows
you to expose all your content in a structured way that AI agents can easily read, search and understand.
