Congrats on shipping that latest release! Unfortunately, many of your users are going to be using the previous version of your app
for hours to days afterwards until they refresh.

Finally fixed that SEO issue? Great, but crawlers will often hit your site and request build chunks that no longer exist, leading
to 500 errors and broken indexes.

You've just been "skewed"! Skew is the version difference between what your users are running and what is currently deployed.
