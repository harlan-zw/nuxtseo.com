Setting simple redirects in Nuxt is easy, but redirects get complicated:

- Potential negative SEO when you forget to set them
- Limited advanced pattern matching for static environments
- Annoying DX with full Nuxt reload when you modify redirects
- Finding 404s to add redirects for

The Magic Redirects module will solve these problems and more by providing a zero-config solution that feels like magic.
