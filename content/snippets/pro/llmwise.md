> Your top pages have lost 20% traffic in the last month to 6 new audit issues. Fix them now?

Building new features is awesome. Making sure the old stuff is working right? Tedious, time-consuming and error-prone.

To get on top of it we need be regularly checking many reports: web vitals through CrUX reports, Google Search Console, Google Lighthouse tests, broken link checking, outdated sitemaps, etc.

Jumping between these tools, remembering to run them, triaging and fixing the issues takes a lot of time and effort.

LLMWise crawls your site running 86 framework-targeted audits, pulling data from 4 Google APIs. Running locally
it gives you complete control of this data.

Your entire site health lives in a local SQLite database, feed this to your existing LLM infrastructure to find the bigger picture.
